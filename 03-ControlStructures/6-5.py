#The electronic thermometer prints the temperature in degrees Celsius
#and verbal information according to the following criteria:

#It is extremely hot, for a temperature above 35 degrees,
#It is hot, for a temperature above 30 degrees,
#It is warm, for a temperature of at least 15 degrees,
#It is cold, for a temperature of at least 0 degrees,
#Warning, frost, for a temperature below 0 degrees.
#Write a program that simulates the operation of an electronic thermometer. 
# Then check the correctness of the program for the following temperatures in degrees Celsius:

#33, 30, 8, 0, -2
