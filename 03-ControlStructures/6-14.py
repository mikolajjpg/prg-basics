#An influencer is a person who can influence other people's behaviour.
#An influencer communicates with other people using social networking sites.
# Write a program that checks whether a given person is a good influencer, that is,
# whether the person has at least two of the following accounts: Facebook, Twitter or Instagram.
 #Use logical type variables: facebook, twitter, instagram,
 #the value of which indicates whether the person has an account on the social networking site.
 #Sample result:

#facebook = True
#twitter = False
#instagram = True
#You are a good influencer!

facebook = True
twitter = False
instagram = True

if facebook + twitter + instagram >=2:
    print("You are a good influencer!")
