#The reduce() function in Python, which is available in the functools module, 
#is used to apply a function cumulatively to the elements of an iterable, 
#reducing it to a single value. 
#Syntax:

#from functools import reduce

#reduce(function, iterable[, initializer])
#Where:

#function: A function that takes two arguments and performs an operation on them.
#iterable: The iterable (like a list, tuple, etc.) whose elements are reduced.
#initializer (optional): An initial value to start the reduction process.
#How reduce() works:

#Takes a function that accepts two arguments.
#Applies the function to the first two elements of the iterable.
#Uses the result of the function to combine with the next element.
#Repeats this process until all elements have been processed.
#Returns a single, reduced value as the final result.
#The following program calculates the sum of numbers. Notice the use of the reduce() function. 
#Then modify the program: replace the regular function add(x,y) with an anonymous function.

from functools import reduce

# Function to add two numbers

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Using reduce to sum the numbers
result = reduce(lambda x,y: x+y, numbers)
print(result)  # Output: 15
