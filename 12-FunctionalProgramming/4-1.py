#The following people are employed in one of the company's departments:

#SMITH Lucy
#JONES Janet
#LEE Jerry
##JACKSON Peter
#JOHNSON Rick
#LEWIS Terry
#CLARKE Robin
#Save the list of employees in a string array. Then, write a program that displays people whose surnames start
#with the letter 'J'. Use anonymous and filter() functions. Sample result:

#JONES Janet
#JACKSON Peter
#JOHNSON Rick
employees = ["SMITH Lucy","JONES Janet","LEE Jerry",
               "JACKSON Peter","JOHNSON Rick",
               "LEWIS Terry","CLARKE Robin"]
emp_J = list(filter(lambda e: e[0]=="J", employees))
# print a list …
for person in emp_J:
    print(person)
